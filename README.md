Project Title

A simple responsive website development for "MR COFFEE".

This simple website has  three pages: where I made header and footer for everypages, the top left of the page has menu bar which has hover effect and links to every pages.
The homepage presents the activity of the Mr.Coffee company, in the home page there is a button where I put some hover effect.
An "About Us" page that  introduces the concept and values behind  Mr.Coffee,
A "Contact Us" page which displays all of Mr.Coffee's contact information (address, email, telephone).

Prerequisites:

1.We need to install visual studio code for writing codes in three html files and one css file , Assets file where I saved all images and one README file,
2.Node.js, git.hub, I used Chrome as my browser

Installation:

To run on a local host server, consider installing live-server as an option.
The NodeJS live-server package runs a temporary server displaying any HTML/CSS/JS resources in the current folder. 
It automatically reloads the page in your browser when any of these files change

Acknowledgments:

The code I used to develop the website, HTML5 and CSS3 
This is fully based on my research, learing from the tutor as well as learning from my class mates.
I have mostly reserched by Google search, youtube, W3school, mozilla , Google font and so on.
HTML, CSS3 is completely new for me, I have been learning only for one week, still I need to know alot of things.
This website is not a complete version of what the MR. Coffee needs, only one week knowledge I tried my best, 
what I have done I understood all, my home page rectangles has no logos, although I tried to inserted, also About
page has some lackings, in the footer I have struggled to set the social logos underneath of the text.

I enjoyed each and evry moment while I was creating this multipage website, I have a plan to learn lot of things to bukld a perfect webpage in near future.
